| Zero internal boundaries | Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: Everyone can get to all tools and files|3|
| | Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|3|
| | Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|3|
| | Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|3|
|Short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|1|
