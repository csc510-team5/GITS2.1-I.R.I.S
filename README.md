# About I.R.I.S
"Your repo is your resume. But what is a good looking repo?"

So you want to start a Project on Github. Ever wondered what makes a project repository good?
What makes your project stand apart when collaborating with multiple developers?
What would ensure that your project is well documented and readable to other developers who might try to work on this in the future?


Worry not. I.R.I.S is here.

I.R.I.S (Ideal ReposItory for Software projects) is a tool which can help developers align their repos as per the standards defined in Software Engineering.

You don't have to worry about whether you missed to add a test case, or scratch your head on what more files/functionalities are needed to make your repository look good.

I.R.I.S streamlines your repository as per the Software Engineering Standards, so that your repository has all the necessary Structure to be called a "Good Repo".

I.R.I.S can be thought of a base repo to make sure your project repo fits the bill.

# Installation Setup
## On Windows Machines

## On Linux/MacOS Machines

# How to Contribute?
Please take a look at our CONTRIBUTING.md where we provide instructions on contributing to the repo and help us in enhancing the current video conferencing platforms.

# Documentation
## Functionalities Implemented

## Experimentation setup for phase 2
(Please check the Projects Tab to see how you can make the project better)

This project aims to ease the developers efforts while working on their project repos. I.R.I.S makes their work easier and saves time by providing all the necessary default files in the required structure to ensure that the developers can focus on making their project better and not worry about the repository.

Here are few motivation points behind coming up with this idea:
- When working on one of the homeworks for the course, we realised the dearth of project repos which adhere to the standard structure.
- Even if the Idea is good, developers miss out on making a good impression due to the inability to make the projects transferable and easily-usable.

To solve the issues described above, we came up with the project **I.R.I.S** that stands for **Ideal ReposItory for Software projects**.

### Tasks list
You can checkout the Projects Tab in GitHub to see the upcoming tasks for the Project.

### Quantitative measures
Here are some measures that can help compare the results between traditional Git/Github Repo Creation and I.R.I.S
1. The default files created as part of the repo creation.
2. The structure followed for the default files.
3. The default template followed for most files, so that even the most layman developer can ensure that his repo adheres to the Standard.
