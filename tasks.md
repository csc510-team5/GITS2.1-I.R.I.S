# Things already done:
## 1. Functionalities added in the current iteration:
Use custom commands to work with Git from your command line.
Create Default files on startup according to the Stucture.
Files will be auto generated with template to give the developers an idea on what needs to be filled.
Auto test case function generation whenever new code gets pushed. Developer can update the necessary tests inside the function.
Score Calculation to see how much the repo matches with the ideal repo structure.
Create a custom command to work with Git and make development fun.
	
## 2. Currently, this project can only be executed on Linux or Mac operating systems.     

# Things that need to be done:
1. INSTALLATION ISSUES - fix installation for windows
2. CUSTOM COMMANDS - custom commands - reset (delete)
3. CUSTOM COMMANDS - list all created custom commands
4. CREATE GOOD REPO - add multiple licenses in create good repo
5. CREATE GOOD REPO - refactor create good repo to use only git commands not gh (Github CLI)

# Deliverables for phase 2:
1. Working installation in Windows
2. Enhance create good repo to work with multiple licenses
3. Custom command listing and delete operations
