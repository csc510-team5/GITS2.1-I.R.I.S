3. The PR should be assigned to the individual requesting a merge.
4. The Reviewers must approve the pull request before merging the code.
5. The description should be updated as to what has been asked in the issue.
6. All the development code should accompany unit test cases to support the validation results.

## Bug Reporting Process

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. You need to create an issue and include all the following details if possible.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

1. Before raising a GitHub issue, make sure that you are running the latest version of the application and have all recommended OS updates / patches installed
2. Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
3. Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Atom, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Atom otherwise. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Atom command, and if so which one?
4. Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/paste-able snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
5. Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
6. Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
7. Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.


## Enhancement suggestion process / Feature request Process

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. You need to create an issue and include all the following details if possible.

1. Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
2. Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
3. Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
4. Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
5. Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a community package.

## Adding new command

1. Create a new file in <PROJECT HOME>/code/gits_<command name>.py
2. Follow the template below to create a new command and update the values in
  <text> with appropriate values

    ```
    from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
    import gits_logging

    def gits_<command name>(args):
        try:
            #Repeat the following code to execute multiple commands
            command = "<command to be executed>"
            process_commands = command.split()
            process = Popen(process_commands, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
            stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
        except Exception as e:
            gits_logging.gits_logger.error("gits <command name> command caught an "
                + "exception")
            gits_logging.gits_logger.error("{}".format(str(e)))
            print("ERROR: gits <command name> command caught an exception")
            print("ERROR: {}".format(str(e)))
            return False
        return True
    ```
3. Add the following entries in <PROJECT HOME>/code/gits.py

    ```
    from gits_<command name> import gits_<command name>
    .
    .
    gits_<command name>_subparser = subparsers.add_parser("<command name>")
    gits_<command name>_subparser.add_argument("<argument variable1>", help = "<description of the variable>")
    gits_<command name>_subparser.add_argument("<argument variable2>", help = "<description of the variable>")
    .
    .
    gits_<command name>_subparser.set_defaults(func=gits_<command name>)
    ```
